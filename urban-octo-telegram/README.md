## Description

This reformatted website for Horiseon not only provides a landing page for the company, but also uses sematnic HTML. I was inspired to update this website's code in order to provide better accesibility features. I learned many important facts about not only semantic HTML, but also the application of on-page links as well as important knowledge of CSS.
